## TODO

- track pieces in each cell and change piece position when multiple pieces are in the same cell so they get visually split
- programatically roll the die according to a desired outcome face
- adapt nakama code from tic-tac-toe (library + login form)
- connect godot client with the server game
- create UI overlay with roll button and a label to provide feedback to the player
