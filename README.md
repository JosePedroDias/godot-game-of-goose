# Godot Game of Goose

Multiplayer game of goose in Godot 4.3 3D.
Uses a relatively basic JSON-messages websocket server
~Needs a [Nakama server counterpart](https://github.com/JosePedroDias/nakama-game-of-goose) to work~


## TODO

- UI overlay with colored pieces and player names, highlight with arrow or alpha which player is playing now

- nice to have: UI roll die button
- nice to have: UI label to provide feedback to the players
- TODO: new client -> server opcode to request the server to print out its internal state
- WIP: resume nakama client after disconnect
- nice to have: particle effects during piece movement
